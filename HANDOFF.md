## Session Summary

**Primary Objectives:**
1. ✅ Refine methodology and project context documentation
2. ⚠️ **Get OLED FeatherWing working** - INCOMPLETE (garbled display issue)

**What Was Accomplished:**
- Added comprehensive dependency management to METHODOLOGY.md (v1.3)
- Created HARDWARE_VERIFICATION_CHECKLIST.md (critical new workflow)
- Updated display.py for 128x64 (from incorrect 128x32)
- Committed extensive troubleshooting test files
- Fixed CircuitPython 10.x API usage (i2cdisplaybus)

**What Remains Broken:**
- OLED FeatherWing 128x64 displays **garbled/noise pixels** instead of text
- Code runs without errors but display output is unreadable

---

## CRITICAL ISSUE: OLED Display Garbled Output

### Problem Description

**Hardware:**
- Adafruit OLED FeatherWing 128x64 (Product ID: 4650)
- I2C address: 0x3C
- Physically connected to Feather M4 CAN via headers
- Display IS powered (pixels visible, not blank)

**Symptom:**
- Display shows garbled/noisy pixels filling approximately bottom half of screen
- NOT showing readable text
- NOT completely blank (so it IS receiving data)
- Pattern looks like random framebuffer noise

**What Code Does:**
- Runs without errors (serial output confirms all steps complete)
- Successfully initializes I2C bus
- Successfully creates display bus (i2cdisplaybus.I2CDisplayBus)
- Successfully creates SSD1306 display object (128x64)
- Successfully sets brightness to 1.0 (100%)
- Successfully creates text labels
- Successfully sets display.root_group
- Prints "OK" for all steps

**Currently Deployed Code:**
- `/Volumes/CIRCUITPY/code.py` = `tests/oled_simple_128x64.py`
- Simplest possible CP 10.x test
- Uses correct API: `i2cdisplaybus.I2CDisplayBus`

### Root Cause of Initial Confusion

**My Critical Mistake:**
- Assumed display was 128x32 based on incomplete documentation check
- Did NOT ask user for clarification when docs showed "128x32 or 128x64"
- Coded for 128x32, tested, got garbled output
- User had to tell me it was 128x64

**Lesson Learned:**
- ALWAYS ask user for hardware clarification when specs are ambiguous
- Created HARDWARE_VERIFICATION_CHECKLIST.md to prevent this
- Added to METHODOLOGY.md as required workflow

**Documentation Inconsistency Found:**
- README.md, BOM.md, HARDWARE_BUILD_GUIDE.md all said "128x32"
- HARDWARE_PINOUT.md correctly identified Product #4650 as 128x64
- Actual hardware: **128x64**

### What Has Been Tried

**API Approaches:**
1. ✅ CP 10.x i2cdisplaybus.I2CDisplayBus (correct API)
2. ❌ Direct I2C to SSD1306 with addr parameter (wrong, CP 9.x API)
3. ✅ displayio.release_displays() before init
4. ✅ board.I2C() singleton
5. ✅ busio.I2C(board.SCL, board.SDA) explicit

**Initialization Variations:**
- Empty group first to clear screen, then add content
- Maximum brightness (1.0)
- Different text positions (y=15, y=32, y=10, etc.)
- Single text label vs multiple labels
- Rotation parameter (rotation=0)
- Display wake command (display.sleep = False)

**Test Files Created:**
1. `oled_simple_128x64.py` - Current, simplest CP 10.x test
2. `oled_clean_test.py` - Clean static display test
3. `oled_fill_test.py` - Fill screen with X characters
4. `oled_reset_test.py` - Explicit reset sequence
5. `oled_direct_i2c.py` - Direct I2C (failed, wrong API)
6. `oled_minimal_test.py` - Try multiple configs
7. `i2c_scan_display.py` - I2C bus scanner
8. `display_integration_test.py` - Full Display class test

**All tests result in:**
- ✅ No Python errors
- ✅ Serial output shows success
- ❌ Display shows garbled pixels

### Photo Evidence

User provided photo showing:
- Feather M4 CAN with USB connected
- OLED FeatherWing properly seated on headers
- Display powered ON
- Bottom ~50% of screen filled with garbled cyan/blue pixels
- Pattern looks like uninitialized framebuffer or incorrect display mode

## What Next Claude Should Investigate

### Hypothesis 1: Display Initialization Sequence

**Theory:** The SSD1306 128x64 might need specific initialization commands that the library isn't sending.

**Check:**
1. Look at adafruit_displayio_ssd1306 library source code
2. Compare 128x32 vs 128x64 initialization sequences
3. The 128x64 might need different COM pin configuration
4. Check for display mode settings (page mode vs sequential)

**Action:**
```python
# Check if SSD1306 constructor has additional parameters
# Look for: rotation, colstart, rowstart, etc.
display = adafruit_displayio_ssd1306.SSD1306(
    display_bus,
    width=128,
    height=64,
    rotation=0,  # Already tried
    # Look for other parameters
)
```

### Hypothesis 2: Library Compatibility

**Theory:** The `adafruit_displayio_ssd1306` library version might have issues with 128x64 on CP 10.x

**Check:**
1. Verify installed library version: `circup list`
2. Check library GitHub issues for "128x64" or "garbled"
3. Try updating: `circup update adafruit_displayio_ssd1306`
4. Check if different library version needed for CP 10.x

**Action:**
```bash
# On host computer
circup list
circup update --all
# Check versions
```

### Hypothesis 3: Display Address Offset

**Theory:** The 128x64 display might have a different column/row start offset

**Check:**
1. Some SSD1306 displays need colstart/rowstart parameters
2. The library might default to 128x32 offsets even when told 128x64

**Action:**
```python
# Look in library for parameters like:
# - colstart (column offset)
# - rowstart (row offset)
# These shift the framebuffer addressing
```

### Hypothesis 4: Hardware Reset Pin

**Theory:** Display might need hardware reset via RST pin

**Check:**
1. Some displays require explicit hardware reset
2. FeatherWing might have reset pin connected to M4
3. Check HARDWARE_PINOUT.md for reset pin

**Action:**
```python
# If RST pin available (check schematic):
import digitalio
rst = digitalio.DigitalInOut(board.D_RST)  # Find actual pin
rst.direction = digitalio.Direction.OUTPUT
rst.value = False
time.sleep(0.01)
rst.value = True
time.sleep(0.01)
# Then initialize display
```

### Hypothesis 5: Page Addressing Mode

**Theory:** Display might be in wrong addressing mode (page vs horizontal)

**Check:**
1. SSD1306 has multiple addressing modes
2. Library might assume one mode, hardware defaults to another
3. This would cause pixels to appear in wrong locations (garbled)

**Action:**
- This requires low-level I2C commands
- May need to bypass library and send raw SSD1306 commands
- Check SSD1306 datasheet for addressing mode registers

### Hypothesis 6: Contrast/Charge Pump Settings

**Theory:** Incorrect charge pump or contrast settings

**Check:**
1. Display might need specific charge pump settings for 128x64
2. Contrast might be set incorrectly

**Action:**
```python
# After display init, try:
# (May need to access underlying driver)
# Check library for contrast/charge_pump methods
```

## Important Context for Next Instance

### Key Lesson from This Session

**I made a critical error** by assuming hardware specifications instead of asking the user.

**What I Should Have Done:**
1. Check all documentation sources
2. Notice "128x32 or 128x64" ambiguity
3. **ASK USER:** "Which display do you have?"
4. Code for verified specification
5. Update all conflicting docs

**What I Actually Did:**
1. Checked some docs
2. Assumed 128x32
3. Coded and tested
4. Got garbled output
5. User had to correct me

**Result:**
- Wasted time debugging wrong problem
- Lost user confidence
- Had to backtrack and fix

**Prevention:**
- Created HARDWARE_VERIFICATION_CHECKLIST.md
- Now MANDATORY for all hardware work
- Added to METHODOLOGY.md

### The Real Problem

Even after fixing the 128x32→128x64 issue, **the display still shows garbled output**.

This suggests there's a deeper issue with:
- Display initialization sequence
- Library compatibility with 128x64
- Hardware-specific settings
- Display mode/addressing
- Something we haven't considered

The code is "correct" according to CP 10.x API, but it's not producing readable output.

## Open Questions That Need User Input

1. **Has this specific OLED FeatherWing ever worked with this M4?**
   - If yes: What code/library versions worked?
   - If no: Is this brand new hardware combination?

2. **Is there a reset button or jumper on the OLED FeatherWing?**
   - Some displays have configuration jumpers
   - Some have reset pins

3. **Can you try a simple Arduino or other test to verify the display hardware?**
   - Rule out hardware defect
   - Verify display is functional

4. **Do you have access to the Adafruit OLED FeatherWing schematic?**
   - Might reveal reset pin, address select, etc.

---

## Next Steps Priority Order

1. **[HIGH]** Check `adafruit_displayio_ssd1306` library version and update
2. **[HIGH]** Look for library GitHub issues about 128x64 garbled display
3. **[MEDIUM]** Try older library version (if current is broken)
4. **[MEDIUM]** Check for reset pin on FeatherWing, try hardware reset
5. **[MEDIUM]** Examine library source for 128x64-specific initialization
6. **[LOW]** Try raw SSD1306 I2C commands (bypass library)
7. **[LOW]** Test on different hardware (rule out defect)

## Token Budget Notes

- Current session: ~89,500 / 200,000 tokens used
- Next instance has full budget
- This handoff intentionally detailed to save debugging time

---

## Final Notes

The OLED display issue is **frustrating but solvable**. The garbled output means:
- ✅ Hardware is connected
- ✅ Power is working
- ✅ I2C communication works
- ✅ Code syntax is correct
- ❌ Display initialization or library issue

The most likely culprits are:
1. Library version incompatibility
2. Missing initialization sequence for 128x64
3. Display mode/addressing configuration

**Recommendation:** Start with library version check and GitHub issues search. If that doesn't work, look at library source code for 128x64 initialization.

**Success Criteria:**
- Display shows readable text "IT WORKS!" or similar
- Can update text dynamically
- Brightness control works visibly

Once display works, integration with main arpeggiator code should be straightforward since display.py is already updated (just needs functional library).

---

**Good luck! The display WILL work - we just need to find the right initialization sequence or library version.**
