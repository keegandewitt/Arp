## Test Results by Category

### ✅ Power Pins
- 3.3V rail: Working
- GND: Working
- USB power: Working
- Battery power: Not tested (no battery connected)

### ✅ GPIO Pins (Digital I/O)
All GPIO pins tested for:
- Digital output (HIGH/LOW)
- Digital input with pull-up resistor
- Digital input with pull-down resistor

**Result:** All GPIO pins passed

### ✅ I2C Pins
- D21 (SDA): Working
- D22 (SCL): Working
- I2C bus initialization: Successful

**Notes:** Ready for OLED display and other I2C peripherals

### ✅ SPI Pins
- D23 (MISO): Working
- D24 (MOSI): Working
- D25 (SCK): Working
- SPI bus initialization: Successful

### ✅ Analog Input Pins (ADC)
- A0-A5: All working
- Voltage readings: Within expected range (0-3.3V)

### ✅ DAC Output Pins (Analog Output)
- A0: Working (0V to 3.3V output confirmed)
- A1: Working (0V to 3.3V output confirmed)

**Notes:** Ready for CV/Gate output

### ✅ PWM Capability
All tested pins support PWM:
- D0, D1, D4, D5, D6, D9, D10, D11, D12, D13
- D21 (SDA), D22 (SCL)

**Result:** PWM working on all capable pins

### ✅ Special Functions
- **NeoPixel LED:** ✅ Working (flashed Red/Green/Blue)
- **Onboard Red LED (D13):** ✅ Working (blinked 3 times)

### ✅ UART Loopback
- **Test:** D0 (RX) to D1 (TX) loopback with jumper wire
- **Result:** ✅ PASSED
- **Baud Rate Tested:** 9600
- **Data Integrity:** 100% (sent and received matched)

**Notes:**
- Required resoldering D0/D1 pins initially (cold solder joint detected)
- After resoldering: UART communication perfect
- Ready for MIDI communication (MIDI uses UART at 31,250 baud)

## Hardware Quality Assessment

### Soldering Quality
- **Overall:** Good
- **Issues Found:** Cold solder joint on D0/D1 (resolved by reflow)
- **Recommendation:** Visual inspection under magnification recommended for all future assemblies

### Pin Integrity
- **Status:** Excellent
- **Pull-up/Pull-down resistors:** All functional
- **No shorts detected**
- **No open circuits detected**

---

## Required Libraries (Installed)

The following CircuitPython libraries are installed and verified:
- `neopixel.mpy` - v10.x bundle
- `adafruit_pixelbuf.mpy` - v10.x bundle (dependency)

---

## Conclusion

The Feather M4 CAN Express has **passed comprehensive hardware validation**. All pins, peripherals, and special functions are working as expected.

**Board Status:** ✅ **APPROVED FOR PROJECT USE**

**Next Steps:**
1. Test OLED FeatherWing (I2C display)
2. Test MIDI FeatherWing (UART MIDI I/O)
3. Integration testing with full arpeggiator code
