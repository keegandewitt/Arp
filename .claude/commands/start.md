# Start - Comprehensive Session Onboarding

Bring a new Claude instance up to speed with complete project context, methodology, current status, and exactly where we left off.

## Your Task:

Provide a comprehensive briefing by reading and synthesizing information from key project files. Present the information in a clear, organized way.

## Instructions for Claude:

### Step 1: Read Core Documentation (in parallel)
Read these files to understand the project:
- `docs/context/CONTEXT.md` - Living context and session handoff
- `METHODOLOGY.md` - Development philosophy and workflows
- `PROJECT_STATUS.md` - Current project state and roadmap
- `README.md` - Project overview (if exists)
- `todo` - Active task list

### Step 2: Check Project State
Run these commands to understand current state:
```bash
git status
git log -5 --oneline
git branch -a
```

### Step 2.5: Verify MCP Tools Configuration
Check that MCP servers are properly configured and connected:

1. **‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT - API Keys Required for MCP Servers:**
   The project uses `.mcp.json` with environment variables. User must have these set in their shell profile (`~/.zshrc`):
   ```bash
   export CONTEXT7_API_KEY="your-key-here"
   export PERPLEXITY_API_KEY="your-key-here"
   export FIRECRAWL_API_KEY="your-key-here"
   ```
   See `docs/CLAUDE_CODE_SETUP.md` for complete setup instructions and how to get API keys.

2. **Read MCP configuration file:**
   - Project: `.mcp.json` (in project root - uses environment variables)
   - IDE: `~/.cursor/mcp.json` (macOS/Linux) or `C:\Users\[username]\.cursor\mcp.json` (Windows)

3. **Verify required MCP servers are configured:**
   - ‚úÖ **context7** - Library documentation lookups
   - ‚úÖ **perplexity** - Deep web search capabilities
   - ‚úÖ **firecrawl** - Advanced web scraping

4. **Check if MCP tools are actually available:**
   - List your available tools (look for `mcp__context7__*`, `mcp__perplexity__*`, `mcp__firecrawl__*`)
   - If MCP servers are configured in the JSON but tools are NOT available, inform the user:
     - "‚ö†Ô∏è MCP servers are configured but not connected"
     - "Possible causes: Missing API keys in environment, need to restart Claude Code"
     - "Check: Run `echo $CONTEXT7_API_KEY` to verify environment variables are set"

5. **Report MCP status in briefing:**
   - If all MCP tools available: "‚úÖ All MCP servers connected"
   - If configured but not connected: "‚ö†Ô∏è MCP servers need API keys or restart to connect"
   - If not configured: "‚ùå MCP servers not configured (see docs/CLAUDE_CODE_SETUP.md)"

### Step 3: Present Briefing

Present the following information to the user in a well-organized format:

#### üéØ Project Overview
- What is this project? (Brief 2-3 sentence summary)
- What hardware platform?
- What's the current development stage?

#### üìç Where We Are Now
- **Current Session Status**: From CONTEXT.md "Session Handoff" section
- **Last Session Summary**: What was accomplished last time
- **Git Status**: Clean or uncommitted changes?
- **Last Commit**: Hash and message
- **Current Branch**: Which branch are we on

#### üé® What We're Building
- Core features and their status (Complete ‚úÖ / In Progress üöß / Planned üìã)
- Current architecture overview
- Hardware configuration summary

#### üî® How We Work Here
Brief summary of key methodology points:
- **Verify-Then-Act Protocol**: Always verify specs before implementation
- **Git Workflow**: Backup ‚Üí Review ‚Üí Commit ‚Üí Push ‚Üí Update CONTEXT
- **Dependency Management**: Always check libraries before deploying
- **Hardware Testing**: Test everything systematically
- **Available Commands**: List any /tidyup or other custom commands
- **MCP Tools Status**: Report connection status (see Step 2.5)

#### üìã Active Tasks
From the `todo` file - what's on the current task list?

#### üöÄ What's Next (Priority Order)
From CONTEXT.md "What's Next" section - immediate priorities

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues
Any active blockers or important gotchas from PROJECT_STATUS.md

#### üìö Quick Reference
Key file locations:
- Main entry: `main.py`
- Core modules: `arp/core/`
- Hardware tests: `tests/`
- Documentation: `docs/`
- Scripts: `scripts/`

Key commands:
```bash
# Deploy to hardware
cp main.py /Volumes/CIRCUITPY/code.py

# Check dependencies
circup list

# Monitor serial output
python3 scripts/monitor_serial.py

# Create backup
python3 scripts/backup.py

# Run tidyup workflow
/tidyup
```

#### üí° Recent Learnings
Highlight 2-3 key lessons learned from METHODOLOGY.md (like the OLED driver discovery, dependency checking importance, etc.)

### Step 4: Ask the User
End with: "I'm up to speed! What would you like to work on?"

## Important Notes:
- **Be concise but comprehensive** - user needs the full picture quickly
- **Use visual markers** (‚úÖ üöß üìã ‚ö†Ô∏è) to make scanning easy
- **Highlight critical info** - blockers, uncommitted changes, active work
- **Don't assume** - if CONTEXT.md says we're mid-task, mention it clearly
- **Focus on continuity** - help user pick up exactly where they left off

## If Files Are Missing:
- If CONTEXT.md doesn't exist, check for `HANDOFF.md` in root
- If documentation is incomplete, note what's missing
- If todo file is empty, check git log for recent activity clues
